                <strong>Every day, you use Google.</strong> You search, you watch, you click. 
                But did you know that same platform is also being used to <em>influence your vote</em>, 
                <em>surveil your data</em>, and <em>control what you can see online</em>?
            </p>
            <p>
                Political actors interact with Google through three "interfaces of power": 
                <strong>advertising platforms</strong> for persuasion, 
                <strong>data requests</strong> for surveillance, and 
                <strong>content removal requests</strong> for censorship.
                Scroll down to explore patterns you might find surprising.

            <h2>1. The Persuasion Machine: Political Ad Spending</h2>
            <p class="description">
                You might think Democrats and Republicans dominate political advertising. 
                <strong>But here's the twist:</strong> they're both outspent by a shadow network 
                of PACs, advocacy groups, and ballot measure campaigns. Explore the data below 
                to see who's really paying to reach you.
            </p>
            <div id="ads-chart" class="chart-container"></div>
            <div class="insight-box">
                <strong>What surprised us:</strong> "Other" advertisers like PACs, advocacy groups, and ballot measure campaigns 
                outspend both major parties combined. That's $1.56 billion from groups you've probably never heard of, 
                versus $359 million from Democrats and $285 million from Republicans. 
                The real players in political advertising aren't the parties at all.

        <!-- Visualization 2: User Data Requests -->
        <section class="visualization-section">
            <h2>2. The Surveillance Interface: Government Data Requests</h2>
            <p class="description">
                While politicians fight over ads, both parties agree on one thing: 
                they want access to your data. The government has made over <strong>1 million requests</strong> 
                for user information from Google—and the number keeps growing, regardless of who's in power.
            </p>
            <div id="requests-chart" class="chart-container"></div>
            <div class="insight-box">
                <strong>The pattern:</strong> Government requests for user data have grown 17 times over since 2009, 
                from about 3,600 requests to over 60,000 per reporting period. 
                Unlike advertising, this growth doesn't care about party lines. 
                Obama, Trump, Biden: the numbers kept climbing under all of them.
            </div>
        </section>

        <!-- Visualization 3: Content Removal by Reason -->
        <section class="visualization-section">
            <h2>3. The Censorship Mechanism: Content Removal Requests</h2>
            <p class="description">
                You might expect government censorship requests to target terrorism or national security threats. 
                <strong>But the data tells a different story.</strong> Most removal requests are about 
                something far more mundane—and perhaps more concerning.
            </p>
            <div id="removal-chart" class="chart-container"></div>
            <div class="insight-box">
                <strong>The surprise:</strong> Defamation accounts for 6,731 requests, more than half of all removals. 
                The government's main reason for asking Google to take down content isn't terrorism or national security. 
                It's protecting someone's reputation. That should make you pause.

        <!-- Visualization 4: Geographic Distribution -->
        <section class="visualization-section">
            <h2>4. Your Vote Matters More If You Live Here</h2>
            <p class="description">
                Not all votes are created equal. Political campaigns concentrate spending in states where 
                elections are competitive—meaning if you live in a "safe" state, you might barely notice 
                a presidential campaign at all.
            </p>
            <div id="map-chart" class="chart-container"></div>
            <div class="insight-box">
                <strong>Look for your state:</strong> California leads with $245 million because it has the most people. 
                But the real story is in the swing states. Pennsylvania got $189 million, Michigan $141 million, 
                and Georgia $137 million, all despite having much smaller populations. 
                Where you live determines how hard campaigns work to persuade you.

        <!-- Visualization 5: Aligned Small Multiples -->
        <section class="visualization-section">
            <h2>5. Three Timelines, One Platform</h2>
            <p class="description">
                Now let's see all three interfaces together. When aligned on the same timeline, 
                a striking pattern emerges: <strong>advertising follows elections, but surveillance never stops.</strong>
            </p>
            <div id="aligned-chart" class="chart-container"></div>
            <div class="insight-box">
                <strong>Notice the contrast:</strong> Political advertising spikes before elections, then drops off. 
                You can see it in the gold lines marking 2018, 2020, 2022, and 2024. 
                Surveillance requests, meanwhile, have grown steadily regardless of who's in office. 
                Content removal peaked around 2016 and has actually declined since then. 
                Each interface follows its own rhythm.
