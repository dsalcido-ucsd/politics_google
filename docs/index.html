        <!-- Introduction -->
        <section class="intro">
            <p class="lead">
                Google serves as a critical infrastructure for political power in America. 
                Political actors interact with Google through three distinct but interconnected systems: 
                <strong>advertising platforms</strong> for persuasion, 
                <strong>data requests</strong> for surveillance, and 
                <strong>content removal requests</strong> for censorship.
            </p>
            <p>
                This explorable explanation reveals how these "interfaces of power" operate across time, 
                showing patterns that emerge during election cycles, across presidential administrations, 
                and through different political parties.

            <h2>1. The Persuasion Machine: Political Ad Spending</h2>
            <p class="description">
                Political parties spend billions to reach voters through Google's advertising platforms. 
                This chart shows weekly spending by Democratic, Republican, and other advertisers since 2018. 
                Notice the dramatic spikes during election cycles.

                <span class="stat">$359M</span> (Democratic) and <span class="stat">$285M</span> (Republican).

            <p class="description">
                The U.S. government regularly requests user information from Google through legal processes 
                like subpoenas and search warrants. This visualization tracks over 1 million requests 
                affecting more than 2 million accounts since 2009.

            <p class="description">
                Government agencies request Google to remove content for various reasons. 
                This chart categorizes over 12,000 removal requests since 2011,

                National security requests, while highly publicized, represent a smaller fraction of total removals.

                <strong>Key Insight:</strong> Political advertising follows a strong cyclical pattern 
                tied to elections, while surveillance and content removal show steady,

            <h2>Understanding the Interfaces</h2>
            <p>
                These visualizations reveal how political power operates through Google's infrastructure. 
                <strong>Persuasion</strong> (advertising) is cyclical, expensive, and partisan. 
                <strong>Surveillance</strong> (data requests) is persistent, growing, and bipartisan. 
                <strong>Censorship</strong> (content removal) focuses on individual reputation 
                rather than political dissent.
            </p>
            <p>
                Together, these three interfaces form a comprehensive picture of how government and 
                political actors leverage one of the world's most powerful information platforms 
                to shape public opinion, gather intelligence, and control online speech.
