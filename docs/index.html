                <strong>Every day, you use Google.</strong> You search, you watch, you click. 
                But did you know that same platform is also being used to <em>influence your vote</em>, 
                <em>surveil your data</em>, and <em>control what you can see online</em>?
            </p>
            <p>
                Political actors interact with Google through three "interfaces of power": 
                <strong>advertising platforms</strong> for persuasion, 
                <strong>data requests</strong> for surveillance, and 
                <strong>content removal requests</strong> for censorship.
                This explorable explanation reveals patterns you might find surprising.

            <h2>1. The Persuasion Machine: Political Ad Spending</h2>
            <p class="description">
                You might think Democrats and Republicans dominate political advertising. 
                <strong>But here's the twist:</strong> they're both outspent by a shadow network 
                of PACs, advocacy groups, and ballot measure campaigns. Explore the data below 
                to see who's really paying to reach you.

            <div class="insight-box">
                <strong>🎯 Surprising Finding:</strong> "Other" advertisers (PACs, advocacy groups, ballot measures) 
                outspend both major parties <em>combined</em>: <span class="stat">$1.56B</span> vs. 
                <span class="stat">$359M</span> (Democratic) and <span class="stat">$285M</span> (Republican). 
                The biggest spenders in American politics aren't the parties—they're hidden behind names you've never heard of.

        <!-- Visualization 2: User Data Requests -->
        <section class="visualization-section">
            <h2>2. The Surveillance Interface: Government Data Requests</h2>
            <p class="description">
                While politicians fight over ads, both parties agree on one thing: 
                they want access to your data. The government has made over <strong>1 million requests</strong> 
                for user information from Google—and the number keeps growing, regardless of who's in power.
            </p>
            <div id="requests-chart" class="chart-container"></div>
            <div class="insight-box">
                <strong>🔍 The Pattern:</strong> Government surveillance through Google has grown 
                <span class="stat">17x</span> since 2009—from ~3,600 requests to over 60,000 per period. 
                Unlike advertising, this growth is <em>bipartisan and relentless</em>. 
                No administration has reversed the trend.

        <!-- Visualization 3: Content Removal by Reason -->
        <section class="visualization-section">
            <h2>3. The Censorship Mechanism: Content Removal Requests</h2>
            <p class="description">
                You might expect government censorship requests to target terrorism or national security threats. 
                <strong>But the data tells a different story.</strong> Most removal requests are about 
                something far more mundane—and perhaps more concerning.
            </p>
            <div id="removal-chart" class="chart-container"></div>
            <div class="insight-box">
                <strong>🚨 The Surprise:</strong> Defamation dominates at <span class="stat">6,731 requests</span>—
                over half of all removals. This means the government's primary use of content removal 
                isn't fighting terrorism; it's <em>protecting reputations</em>. 
                National security requests are a small fraction of the total.

        <section class="visualization-section">
            <h2>4. Your Vote Matters More If You Live Here</h2>
            <p class="description">
                Not all votes are created equal. Political campaigns concentrate spending in states where 
                elections are competitive—meaning if you live in a "safe" state, you might barely notice 
                a presidential campaign at all.
            </p>
            <div id="map-chart" class="chart-container"></div>
            <div class="insight-box">
                <strong>💡 Find Your State:</strong> California leads with <span class="stat">$245M</span> 
                (large population = large audience), but the <em>per-capita</em> spending tells the real story. 
                Pennsylvania (<span class="stat">$189M</span>), Michigan (<span class="stat">$141M</span>), 
                and Georgia (<span class="stat">$137M</span>) receive massive targeting despite smaller populations 
                — because they decide elections. <strong>Your geography determines your exposure to political persuasion.</strong>

            <h2>5. Three Timelines, One Platform</h2>
            <p class="description">
                Now let's see all three interfaces together. When aligned on the same timeline, 
                a striking pattern emerges: <strong>advertising follows elections, but surveillance never stops.</strong>
            </p>
            <div id="aligned-chart" class="chart-container"></div>
            <div class="insight-box">
                <strong>📊 The Contrast:</strong> Political advertising spikes predictably before elections 
                (look for the gold lines marking 2018, 2020, 2022, 2024). But surveillance and content removal? 
                They grow steadily <em>regardless of election cycles</em>. The persuasion machine turns on and off; 
                the surveillance machine never stops.

        <!-- Conclusion -->

            <h2>The One Thing You Should Remember</h2>
            <p>
                <strong style="font-size: 1.3em; color: #6fb0ff;">
                    Google isn't just a search engine—it's infrastructure for political power.
                </strong>
            </p>
            <p>
                Three interfaces, three very different patterns:
            </p>
            <ul style="margin: 20px 0; padding-left: 25px; color: #e6eef8;">
                <li><strong>Persuasion</strong> (advertising) is cyclical, expensive, and dominated by dark money PACs—not the parties themselves.</li>
                <li><strong>Surveillance</strong> (data requests) is persistent, growing 17x since 2009, and bipartisan.</li>
                <li><strong>Censorship</strong> (content removal) focuses on protecting reputations, not national security.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                The next time you use Google, remember: you're not just a user. 
                You're a data point in a system that political actors use to persuade, surveil, and control.
